## S3 (Simple Storage Service)

#### Overview
* Object Based: think of a place to upload files (can’t install OS or DB on it)
* Files can be from 0 bytes to 5 TB
* Total storage is unlimited
* Files are stored in “buckets” that must have unique name (only one namespace)
* URL will look like: https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bucketname
* When you successfully upload a file, it will return a HTTP 200 code

#### Data Consistency Model
* Read after write consistency after PUTS of new objects
* Eventual consistency of overwrite PUTS and DELETES (Can take some time to propagate)
* PUTS and DELETES are atomic, no partial or corrupted data

#### S3 is a Key - Value store that contains:
1. Key (name of object)
1. Value (the actual data, made up of sequence bytes)
1. Version ID
1. Metadata
1. Subresources
  1. Access control lists (who can access this object)
  1. Torrent (bit torrent protocol)

#### Tiers (in decreasing order of cost):
1. S3
  * 99.99% availability (99.9% guaranteed)
  * 99.999999999% durability guarantee (9 x 11)
  * Durable, immediately available, frequently accessed
1. S3 - IA (Immediate Access)
  * Durable, immediately available, infrequently accessed
1.  S3 - Reduced Redundancy Storage
  * Good for data that is easily reproducible like thumbnails
1. Glacier
  * Archival Data
  * Must wait 3 - 5 hours before accessing

#### S3 Versioning
* Stores all versions of an object including “delete markers”
* Great for backups
* Once enabled, versioning cannot be disabled, only suspended
* Integrates with lifecycle rules
* Can be set up to force multi-factor authentication for deletes

#### Cross Region Replication
* Can set up buckets so that uploading to one bucket will cause the file to be replicated in another bucket
* Versioning must be enabled on both buckets
* Both buckets cannot be in the same region
* Existing files in a bucket will not get copied over when replication is set up, but they will be copied if they are updated
* Deleting a file in the source bucket will delete the file in the replica bucket (delete marker will be copied over)
* Restoring a file by deleting the delete marker *will not* be replicated - actually, any deletion of versions will not be replicated
* Currently supports only one replication target, so you can't upload to one bucket and have it replicated in two other buckets.
* Currently does not support chained replication (new/updated files will only be copied to the first target)

#### Life Cycle Management
* Used to save money by moving old objects to S3 - IA and Glacier
* Can be configured to handle current and previous versions differently
* Actions:
  * Transition to S3 - IA (128KB and 30 days after creation date)
  * Transition to Glacier (30 days after IA, if relevant)
  * Permanently delete

#### CloudFront
* Content Delivery Network (CDN): a system of distributed servers that deliver webpages and other web content to a user based on the geographic locations of the user, the origin of the webpage and a content delivery server.
* Edge location: location where content will be cached (separate from AWS region or availability zone)
* Origin: the origin of all files that the CDN will distribute. Can be:
  * S3 bucket
  * EC2 instance
  * Elastic Load Balancer
  * Route53
* Distribution: name given to the CDN which consists of a collection of edge locations.
  * type: Web Distribution - Typically used for websites
  * type: Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) - used for media streaming
* Things to remember for exam
  * you can invalidate objects manually before they expire if you need to
  * can be used for downloading files as well as uploading files
  * you can set it to use a blacklist or whitelist (you pick which countries)

 #### Security and Encryption
* All newly created buckets are private by default
* Setting up access control:
  * Bucket Policies
  * Access Control Lists
* S3 can be configured to log all requests
* 2 types of Encryption
  * In transit (SLL/TLS)
  * At Rest
    * Server Side Encryption
      * S3 Managed Keys (SSE-S3)
      * AWS Key Management Service, Managed Keys (SSE-KMS)
      * Server Side Encryption with Customer Provided Keys (SSE-C)
    * Client Side Encryption
