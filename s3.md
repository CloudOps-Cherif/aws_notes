## S3 (Simple Storage Service)

#### Overview
* Object Based: think of a place to upload files (can’t install OS or DB on it)
* Files can be from 0 bytes to 5 TB
* Total storage is unlimited
* Files are stored in “buckets” that must have unique name (only one namespace)
* URL will look like: https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bucketname
* When you successfully upload a file, it will return a HTTP 200 code

#### Data Consistency Model
* Read after write consistency after PUTS of new objects
* Eventual consistency of overwrite PUTS and DELETES (Can take some time to propagate)
* PUTS and DELETES are atomic, no partial or corrupted data

#### S3 is a Key - Value store that contains:
1. Key (name of object)
1. Value (the actual data, made up of sequence bytes)
1. Version ID
1. Metadata
1. Subresources
 1. Access control lists (who can access this object)
 1. Torrent (bit torrent protocol)

#### Tiers (in decreasing order of cost):
1. S3
 * 99.99% availability (99.9% guaranteed)
 * 99.999999999% durability guarantee (9 x 11)
 * Durable, immediately available, frequently accessed
1. S3 - IA (Immediate Access)
 * Durable, immediately available, infrequently accessed
1.  S3 - Reduced Redundancy Storage
 * Good for data that is easily reproducible like thumbnails
1. Glacier
 * Archival Data
 * Must wait 3 - 5 hours before accessing

#### S3 Versioning
* Stores all versions of an object including “delete markers”
* Great for backups
* Once enabled, versioning cannot be disabled, only suspended
* Integrates with lifecycle rules
* Can be set up to force multi-factor authentication for deletes
